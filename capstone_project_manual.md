## Capstone project description in [QUBES](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/cyverse_fmn/collections/all)

The capstone project is a chance for you to apply the skills we have presented in the Fall 2020 FOSS Online course. The capstone outline below proposes some activities which we think will test your skills. We are open to your suggestions and ultimately, your team can present whatever you feel comfortable - remember, we are not expecting mastery. Instead, we want you to leave the course with some clear ideas of what skills you want to learn more about to apply FOSS in your own work.  

## Milestones and Due Dates  

- Week 6 (Oct 19th week): Each team will have 30 minutes during the class to map out a strategy for their project and get feedback. 

- OH Week (Oct 26th week): This is an Office Hour week and CyVerse team members will be available to help you. Appointments (by team) are requested so we can get to everyone who needs help.

- Week 7 (November 2nd week): Each team will make a 5-minute presentation summarizing their work 



### Capstone Outline 

Here are some guidelines on what your capstone project should minimally contain. We are open to alternatives and suggestions. 

Presentation component: 
- One spokesperson for the team should present 5-7 slides.  
  We will provide a space in QUBES to deposit these. Of those slides, we request the following: 

a. Be sure to indicate team members.  
b. Have a flowchart detailing the technologies your team has used (e.g. Docker, Git/GitHub, CyVerse, etc.).  
c. Have a “Lessons Learned” slide, with a summary from the team and what you hope to do next.  


### Capstone Project Components 

Ideally, your project should include a variety of components that each member of your team can work on or contribute to. Some activities might require a higher level of coding skills (e.g. building a Docker container). Some activities might require a higher level of communication skills (e.g., writing a piece of documentation for a tool).  

Here are some ideas of what to build for your project. Keep in mind, your project can include (and may even require) some skills we have not directly covered in class. We can provide assistance here during Office Hours, or you may want to spend time learning and working as a team to get those components done.  

#### Tool/Development Project  (These could be done separately or together)  

    Take some software tools that you use now and make them into a Docker container

    Take some software tool you use now and write a shell script or Snakemake file to automate your workflow 

    Deploy your tool on CyVerse Atmosphere/XSEDE Jetstream, or as a CyVerse VICE application 

    Develop a GitHub repository (with licence) to maintain code for a project 

    Build a GitHub page to document your tool

#### Collaboration and Documentation  (These could be done separately or together) 

    Take a software tool of your choice and build a GitHub webpage to better document that software or present a tutorial 

    Use a GitHub page to build a Code of Conduct or a Data Management Plan for your laboratory 

    Visit the GitHub page of a software project you currently use and make a contribution to their documentation or code
